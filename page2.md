# My information 

I am Ethan Mantle, an undergraduate at the *University of Missouri - Columbia*. I am in the College of Engineering studying Information Technology and getting a certificate in Cyber Security. 
After graduation, I plan to apply the cyber security skills I learned to work in the intelligence sector of the U.S Government, such as the following:
- CIA - Central Intelligence Agency
- NSA - National Security Agency
- NGA - National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency

I like to play strategy games to test my brain, and exercise to make myself both stronger and healthier.
